# ChatBot
In this example, the chatbot is trained on the English corpus using the ChatterBotCorpusTrainer. The train() method loads the corpus and trains the chatbot. The English corpus includes a large collection of conversational dialogues.
The chatbot then enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input using input(). It retrieves a response from the chatbot using get_response() and prints it out.
You can customize and enhance the chatbot by training it on additional corpora, adding your own custom logic, integrating it with APIs for more specific responses, or using more advanced NLP techniques.
